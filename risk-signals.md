# Risk Signals

Risk signals are indicators of elevated harm potential.
They are not proof of wrongdoing.

## Examples of useful signals

- Action velocity (too fast, too uniform)
- Time-of-day clustering
- Repeated account creation attempts
- Rapid profile recycling
- High outbound messaging with low replies
- Frequent off-platform link attempts

## Signals to treat carefully

- Location changes
- Language use
- Profile content alone

## What risk signals are for

- Adjusting rate limits
- Triggering review queues
- Increasing friction
- Prioritizing reports

## Failure modes

- Over-weighting one signal
- Freezing signals over time
- Letting models drift unchecked
- Treating risk scores as truth

## Open questions

- Which signals decay fastest?
- Which signals correlate with false positives?
- How often should signals be re-evaluated?
