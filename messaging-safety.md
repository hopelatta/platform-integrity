# Messaging Safety

## Common risks

- Harassment escalation
- Coercive language
- Image abuse
- Rapid pressure to move off-platform
- Disappearing message misuse

## Design levers that help

- Message rate limits
- First-message friction
- Delayed image sharing
- Link warnings
- Reporting access inside threads

## Disappearing messages

They reduce data retention.
They also remove evidence.

Tradeoffs:
- Safer for privacy
- Riskier for accountability

## What not to do

- Force users to explain trauma to report
- Hide reporting behind menus
- Remove message history without consent
- Treat all conversations as equal risk

## Open questions

- When should platforms slow conversations?
- How can users signal discomfort without escalation?
- What safety tools work without breaking intimacy?
