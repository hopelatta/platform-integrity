# Integrity Metrics

## Common but misleading metrics

- Reports per DAU
- Bans issued
- Content removed
- Time to action

## Better questions to ask

- Did harm stop?
- Did it recur?
- Did users feel supported?
- Did enforcement create new risk?

## Useful integrity indicators

- Repeat offender rates
- Time between incidents
- Post-report user retention
- Appeal success rates
- False positive audits

Metrics should be reviewed manually.

## Metric risks

- Optimizing for low reports hides harm
- Fast enforcement increases mistakes
- Aggregate metrics erase edge cases

## Open questions

- Which harms are invisible to metrics?
- What should never be optimized?
- When should qualitative review override dashboards?
